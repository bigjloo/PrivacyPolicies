      <a href='#1'>[1]</a> of the privacy policy clearly states the purpose of collecting the personal information which adhere to privacy principle 3. For principle 5, which concerns the storage and security of personal information, we can see from <a href='#2'>[2]</a> that the agency uses encrypted files and has set up user access management in place to prevent unauthorized misuse. <a href='#3'>[3]</a> of the privacy policy informs the user of their rights to have their personal information corrected if they think it is wrong (privacy principle 7). To prevent holding information longer than necessary (privacy principle 9), the privacy police states that the agency only keeps the personal information for 90 days which it is then securely erased <a href='#4'>[4]</a>. Section <a href='#5'>[5]</a> adheres to principle 11, which does not identify any individual.
